# Merezhkovsky

Drafts of Merezhkovsky's Julian/Leonardo/Peter trilogy. I am actively (starting 5/31/2015) working on _Julian the Apostate_, the first novel in the trilogy. 

Currently I hold the copyright to all these translations and reserve all rights. I hope to put them under a fairly permissive license once they're polished and ready for publication, which will allow for mashups (such as adding critical apparatus, adapting for other media, etc.).
